# FP.1 : Match 3D Objects

The `matchBoundingBoxes` function iterates through all points found in the `matches` vector, and
determines if the point in question exists in the previous and current frames. If this is true, the
count of the occurrence is updated within a temporary vector named `listOfMatches`. Otherwise, the
loop continues on to the next point in the `matches` vector. Once all points in the `matches` vector
have been compared, another `for` loop is used to iterate through all points in the tempoary
vector, and store the best points in the `bbMatches` map.

# FP.2 : Compute Lidar-based TTC

The time to collision (TTC) was calculated using the following formula:

```cpp
TTC = (minXCurr * dT) / (averageXPrev - averageXCurr);
```

The `minXCurr` is distance of the closest lidar point from the preceding vehicle. The `averageXCurr`
and `averageXPrev` are the average distances of lidar points in the current and preceding frames,
respectively.

Originally, I did attempt to use the formulas mentioned in previous lessons, however, the results
were supbar.

# FP.3 : Associate Keypoint Correspondences with Bounding Boxes

The keypoint matches are clustered and associated with bounding boxes in the
`clusterKptMatchesWithROI` function. A `for` loop iterates through all points in the `kptMatches`
vector, checks if the point exists in the given bounding box, and if so, stores it in a vector.
Next, the average distance of all points found in the bounding box is calcuated. Finally, another
`for` loop again iterates through all the points in the `kptMatches` vector, checks if it's again
within the bounding box, and if the current point falls within a distance threshold. If so, the
point is stored in that bounding box's keypoint matches.

# FP.4 : Compute Camera-based TTC

The formula used in the `computeTTCCamera` function was adapted from the previous lessons. The TTC
was calculated by iterating through all points in the `kptMatches` vector, and each of those points
to all other points in the same vector using an inner `for` loop.

The formula used to calculate the TTC is as follows:

```cpp
TTC = -dT / (1 - medDistRatio);
```

The median distance was used to remove any outlier influence.

# Performance Evaluation

In some cases, the TTC Lidar estimation very obviously inaccurate, and this occurred when the
number of points detected by the detector and descriptor combination detected very few points.
Having a small number of points to base measurements off would explain poor accuracy in timing
estimation. The happened when the Harris detector was used in combination with other descriptor
type.
